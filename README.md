# Express-Video-Chopper
This script was written to provide a user interface with key bindings only. The purpose for creating this program was to provide a sufficient way to chop
video specifically designed for baseball usage in order to complete a full condensed version of a full 9 inning game.

When the program starts you will be prompted to select an mp4 file as well as a directory to save the final video in. The program will pause once you 
save to prevent any accidental key bindings to fire when using other programs or are in other windows. 


Pause               =	'p'
Unpause		          =	'1' + 'p'
Remove last pitch	  =	'r'
Fast forward		    =	‘Ctrl’ (toggle on)
Normal speed        = 'Ctrl' (toggle off)
Rewind		          =	Left Arrow Key
Jump 30 seconds	    =	Right Arrow Key
Save video		      =	's'
Record		          =	Spacebar (toggle on)
Stop Recording	    =	Spacebar (toggle off)
